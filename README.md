# Python-Projects
Created a Contractor's Estimating Form for a Windows Tablet using Python. The form has Textboxes
for user input of Data and takes pictures using the Tablet's camera. The Software creates
a pdf with all the user input for the job. The software uses SQLITE and exports Data into a csv file. Photos are saved
in the chosen folder by the user.
